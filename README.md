The biggest criticisms of modern ML is about it’s black-box nature— input data, output as in prediction/forecasting and that is ML algorithm’s workings in simple sense. Here comes the complexity — when we have a highly non-linear model with high degrees of interactions, how can we possibly hope to have a simple understanding of what the model is doing? As machine learning has matured into wide-spread adoption, building models that users can understand is becoming increasingly important. This is prevalent in high risk applications e.g. healthcare as well as high data sensitive areas e.g banking & financials.
Let us revisit our insurance claim fraud data: Probability of Fraudulent claim. The data that we have here is from Automobile Insurance. The answer between YES/NO, is a Binary Classification task. Therefore, the reporting here will deal with classification algorithm to detect fraud transaction.
